x The information about players is historic.  

x For each team, the league wants to keep track of all of the players who have ever played on the team, including the current players.  
x For each player, it wants to know about every team the player ever played for.  
x On the other hand, coach affiliation and bat information is current, only.

x WCL wants to keep track of each team’s team number, which is unique, its name, the city in which it is based, and the name of its manager.  
X Coaches have a name (which is only assumed to be unique within its team) and a telephone number.  
X Coaches have units of work experience, which are described by the type of experience and the number of years of that type of experience.  

x Bats are described by their serial numbers (which are only unique within a team) and their manufacturer’s name.  

x Players have a player number that is unique across the league, a name, and an age.

x A team has at least one and usually several coaches.  
x A coach works for only one team.  
x Each coach has several units of work experience or may have none.  
x Each unit of work experience is associated with the coach to whom it belongs.  
x Each team owns at least one and generally many bats.  
x Currently and historically, each team has and has had many players.  
x To be of interest to the league, a player must have played on at least one and possibly many teams during his career.  
x Further, the league wants to keep track of the number of years that a player has played on a team and the batting average that he compiled on that team.
