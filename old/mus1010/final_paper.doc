\insrsid9841637 h it was written during other }{\insrsid9179240 eras }{\insrsid9841637 of music}{\insrsid9179240  history.  T}{\insrsid9841637 here are two different types of concertos in the }{\insrsid9179240 Baroque }{\insrsid9841637 era}{
\insrsid9179240 . }{\cf2\insrsid9841637  }{\insrsid9179240 The first is the solo concerto, wher}{\insrsid9841637 e there is a single instrumental }{\insrsid9179240 soloist }{\insrsid9841637 accompanied by}{\insrsid9179240  an orchestra. }{
\cf2\insrsid9841637  }{\insrsid9179240 There is also }{\insrsid9841637 the}{\insrsid9179240  concerto grosso}{\insrsid9841637 , where there are multiple instrumental }{\insrsid9179240 soloists with an orchestra.  }{\insrsid16581796 Both 
types of concertos have multiple movements.  }{\insrsid9179240 The sequence of movements consists of a fast ritornello form followed by }{\insrsid8012477 a slow movement in any form}{\insrsid9179240 , and }{\insrsid8012477 the concerto ends}{
\cf2\insrsid9179240\charrsid1248406  }{\insrsid9179240 with a fast ritornello form.  Ritornello form is an alternation of sections for the orches}{\insrsid1459685 tra and sections of the soloist or soloists}{\insrsid9179240 , 
with no set number for either.  However, you must always begin and end with the orchestra.  Most or all of the orchestra}{\insrsid14947 l}{\insrsid9179240  sections are related thematically.  }{\insrsid5508570 The form}{\insrsid9179240  begin}{

\par \tab Baroque music was most commonly }{\insrsid10694264 composed }{\insrsid9179240 from about 1600 to 1750.  Several composers }{\insrsid475378 of}{\insrsid9179240  this era are Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Purcell, and Monteverdi.  The most defining character}
{\insrsid15148704 istic of the Baroque era is the use of}{\insrsid9179240  bass continuo.  This is }{\insrsid16660480 a}{\insrsid9179240  bass line and an implied series of chords.  It is normally played by the }{\insrsid6575034 harpsichord, the}{
\insrsid8995773  organ, or large lutes, and the bass line is r}{\insrsid9179240 einforced by the cello or bassoon.  }{\insrsid16714354 Baroque music}{\insrsid9179240  was first developed in connection }{\insrsid12069042 with}{\insrsid9179240   
opera, but then broke off into its own genre of music.  }{\insrsid14638995 Another o}{\insrsid9179240 ne of the major ideas behind Baroque music is that the music must have emotion.  }{\insrsid14508788 E}{\insrsid9179240 motion is most obvious when there
\rquote s sung text, but instrumental music can sometimes \'93emulate\'94 emotion by copying the styles of vocal music.}{\insrsid3761423   A listener must be moved by a particular emotion over a sustained period of time.}{\insrsid9179240  }{
\insrsid340809 The composer most }{\insrsid9179240 often focuses on one emotion per movement.}{\insrsid3422653   }{\insrsid13057088 The one emotion per movement makes it so there is an interest in continuity; therefore 
there is very little contrast in any of the musical fundamentals.}{\insrsid9179240   }{\cf2\insrsid13057088 
\par }{\insrsid9179240 \tab }{\insrsid8535897 \'93Winter\'94}{\insrsid9179240  as a whole has three different movements.  The }{\insrsid8535897 performing forces}{\insrsid9179240  }{\insrsid5255593 are like most Baroque orchestras, and consist of}{
\insrsid9179240  stringed inst}{\insrsid5255593 ruments, the continuo played by the harpsichord, and the solo violin.  }{\insrsid12417939 Vivaldi follows the expected sequence of movements, and goes fast, slow, then fast again.  i 
and iii are in ritornello form, although the solo violin starts in iii.  The form of this particular slow movement is AA\rquote .}{\cf2\insrsid9179240\charrsid1248406

 get shorter as the movement progresses, and makes it seem as if there is a tempo change}{\insrsid9179240 .  The key is minor, and}{\insrsid3848  the movement}{\insrsid9179240  rarely gets into }{\insrsid11675776 a}{\insrsid9179240  
major key, although there is a small hint of it near the middle where the }{\insrsid11675776 rhythms pick up}{\insrsid9179240 . }{\cf2\insrsid11675776  }{\insrsid9179240 As }{\insrsid11675776 this happens}{\insrsid9179240  it gives me the }{
\insrsid6841979 impression of chattering teeth, as described }{\insrsid9179240 in the poem.}{\insrsid7612237   There are a lot of repeated notes}{\insrsid14239386  in the slower rhythms, for chattering teeth, and the shorter ones for the shivering.}{

then going down, then picking back up again.
\par \tab The second movement is in the }{\insrsid1863724 major}{\insrsid9179240  key, and starts out at a slow pace.  The slow pace reminds me of snow falling gently.  Although it does not mention this specifically in the poem, perhaps Vivaldi felt it wo
uld portray a feeling of }{\insrsid2643170 calmness, maybe even a sad feeling,}{\insrsid9179240  that Winter normally brings. The texture is }{\insrsid6313164 melody-accompaniment}{\insrsid9179240 , }{\insrsid6313164 
with a lyrical melody in the violin accompanied by the pit-pat rain in the orchestra.}{\insrsid9179240  Through the entire melody, you feel sad}{\insrsid5582860 .  }{\insrsid2688458

\insrsid2688458   }{\insrsid9179240 The third }{\insrsid7812580 movement starts in a minor key and }{\insrsid9179240 at a very rapid pace.  }{\insrsid11477060 The tempo slows in the middle of the movement, and 
then Vivaldi increased the tempo for a big push at the end, like when the poem says \'93scurrying off the ice\'94}{\insrsid9179240 . The way the music starts at a high pitch then makes its way down }{\insrsid11477060 suggests the}{\insrsid9179240  \'93

piece occurs}{\insrsid9179240  near the end of the third movement when it }{\insrsid4615972 becomes}{\insrsid9179240  quiet, then builds itself up}{\insrsid4615972 , }{\insrsid9179240 
higher and louder.  This bold statement by Vivaldi shows the power of Winter as a whole.  }{\insrsid12135127 In my opinion, this is perhaps the most exciting movement in the concerto}{\insrsid9179240 .}{\cf2\insrsid12135127
