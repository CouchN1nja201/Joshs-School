      <P align=left><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
      size=2>Guardians tend to be both helpful and dutiful, with a strong work 
      ethic that can take them far. However, grand rewards aren't necessarily 
      very important to Guardians. Instead, they tend to be humble types who are 
      happy to simply receive gratitude for a job well done. Guardians are 
      typically more cautious and deliberate that many people are; this is not a 
      temperament that jumps into any personal or professional situation 
      half-cocked. Their grounded approach to life can make Guardians loyal 
      mates, responsible parents, and stabilizing leaders. Indeed, this group 
      can serve as the very cornerstone of society. They tend to be concerned 
      citizens who are willing to join together with others around them. Perhaps 
      this is because Guardians typically value the camaraderie and security 
      inherent in belonging to groups. As law-abiding individuals who place 
      trust in authority, Guardians will often go out of their way to seek out 
      justice. </FONT></P>

      <P align=left><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>As 
      a Supervisor, you probably like to take charge in group situations. You 
      may also find that you're more comfortable issuing orders than many around 
      you are. Oftentimes this will result in you taking on the outspoken 
      leadership role in the organizations you belong to. However being 
      outspoken doesn't mean being difficult. Ordinarily, you're the kind to be 
      very cooperative with superiors -- just as you appreciate cooperation from 
      those working under you. For the most part, hierarchies make sense to you. 
      You likely feel that rank is something someone earns; it has its 
      obligations, but it also has its privileges. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
      size=2>You're better than most people are at making schedules, agendas, 
      inventories, and the like. Perhaps this is because you enjoy doing these 
      things. Organization gives you a certainty that feels very comfortable. 
      Also, if you have a choice between using an established way to accomplish 
      something, or experimenting with new methods, you'll usually opt for the 
      tried-and-true. Speculation can make you nervous. Whether at work or at 
      home, you're one who likes to keep your feet firmly on the ground and 
      would like those around you to do the same. This is particularly true if 
      they're an individual who is under your watch, like a staff member or one 
      of your children. You're part of a group that has no problem evaluating 
      others. In your own life you may find that you tend to judge how the 
      people around you are doing in terms of their compliance with and respect 
      for schedules and procedures. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
      size=2>It's in your makeup to be a respectful person and an incredibly 
      hard worker. Even as a child you were likely quite industrious and showed 
      respect for your parents and other authority figures. In school, these 
      qualities often make Supervisors like you model students. If this was true 
      of you, you likely followed directions dutifully, did all your homework,

      to do what they're supposed to do. As a result your type is not one to 
      question teachers' assignments, method of instruction, standards, or 
      authority. The industry and perseverance you showed as a child has 
      probably only become more central to who you are today as you take on more 
      adult responsibilities like work and family. </FONT></P>

      a Supervisor, you'll tend to approach human relations along traditional 
      lines. Marriage and parenthood are likely sacred bonds to you. You'll also 
      tend to keep a large circle of friends, faithfully maintaining many 
      friendships across the years. Social gatherings and ceremonies can also 
      have a special place in your heart. You seem to like seeing people come 
      together. As a result, you're usually one who looks forward to holiday 
      parties, club dances, weddings, class reunions, awards banquets, and the 
      like. In most social situations, you're apt to be friendly to others and 
      make conversation easily. However because of your traditional nature, you 
      can come off as a bit formal sometimes. But for the most part, Supervisors 
      like you are pretty easy to get to know. You're at ease in polite company 
      and tend not to confuse people by sending double messages or putting on 
      airs. What people see is what they generally get - and this is a quality 
      to be appreciated. </FONT></P>

      being happy in their current position. Challenging work and altruistic 
      service seemed to be the factors that created the most job satisfaction 
      for Guardians. Perks like being allowed to bring pets to work or have 
      company-sponsored beer on Fridays held much less importance. Guardians are 
      types who enjoy being of service, so feeling challenged and providing

      high on Introversion tend to be private and reserved. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>People strong 
      in Extraversion are typically more comfortable socializing with groups 
      than being alone. They often report that they're energized by contact with 
      other people. These individuals usually have a large circle of friends and 
      are happy to approach others, even strangers, to talk. For people high in 
      Extraversion, social banter is usually an easy and pleasant thing. 
      Interaction is something that makes them feel alive. As a result, too much 
      quiet and seclusion can actually exhaust such persons. They tend to report 
      feelings of loneliness or power drain when not in contact with others. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>On the other 
      hand, people prone to Introversion often seem more comfortable alone than 
      in a crowd. They tend to draw energy from private, solitary activities, 
      including reading, listening to music, and working by themselves on their 
      latest project or favorite hobby. Introverts usually have a few, long-time 
      friends, and can remain in contact with larger groups only so long before 
      their energies are depleted. If their job, family, or social 
      responsibilities require them to be outgoing or take center stage, they 
      can soon become exhausted and need down time in quiet places to rest and 
      recharge their batteries. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Remember, 
      however, that no one is simply an "Extravert" or an "Introvert." These 
      terms are merely end points on the E-I scale, with most everyone falling 
      somewhere in between. Most individuals embody a mixture of these two 
      social styles. Also, different tasks or roles at work or in the family can 
      bring out more Extraversion or Introversion in a person. This dimension of 
      personality, more than the other three, is fluid and situational.

      <B>S</B>ensory/<B>I</B>ntuitive (S-N) scale on the Temperament Sorter 
      differentiates between two distinct kinds of human focus. People with high 
      Sensory scores pay more attention to what is going on outside themselves 
      in the world of concrete things; people with high Intuitive scores pay 
      more attention to what is going on inside themselves in the abstract world 
      of ideas. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Sensory 
      people make up the vast majority of the population -- upwards of 85%. 
      These people seem more at home in the material world, where they spend 
      their time looking after the business of everyday living: food and 
      clothing, transportation and shelter, job and family, recreation and 
      social life. With their eye on physical realities, they tend to see all 
      the particulars of what is right in front of them. They typically focus on 
      what's happening in the here-and-now, or what has happened in the past, 
      rather than speculating about future possibilities. These are practical, 
      down-to-earth people who want facts, trust facts, and remember facts. They 
      believe in common sense and usually trust that experience is the best 
      teacher. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In contrast, 
      people who are strongly Intuitive seem more at home in the abstract, 
      conceptual world of ideas. Intuitive types deal in inferences, theories, 
      daydreams, musings, speculations, and symbols -- things that can only be 
      seen with the mind's eye. In fact, because they're so often focused on 
      their internal world, these individuals can sometimes miss a great deal of 
      what's going on around them. For highly Intuitive people, reality is not a 
      solid, present thing, but is more a mental image or a stage of development 
      toward some future ideal. The possible almost always looms large for 
      Intuitive people: whatever "is" can be better. They can be fascinated by 
      hypotheses and potentials. They are also often absorbed by their vivid and 
      complex imaginations. The S-N scale measures the most fundamental of the 
      four dimensions of personality. It's the first cut, so to speak, in 
      evaluating one's type. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>However, this 
      delineation doesn't mean that being Intuitive or Sensory is an "either-or" 
      proposition. Intuitive individuals certainly turn outward at times and pay 
      attention to the world at large; they're just far more inclined to become 
      preoccupied with their own ideas. So too, Sensory people do sometimes look 
      inward to ponder and to dream. However, for the most part their flights of 
      imagination lag well behind their real-world observations. Neither type 
      can occupy both worlds at once, and each will usually show a clear 
      preference for one over the other. </FONT></P>

      guns, even if it causes conflict with others. They're known for being 
      tough-minded in their decisions, preferring to keep emotions and desires 
      out of the process as much as possible. Thinking types do have powerful 
      feelings, but a strong show of emotion can embarrasses them. As a result, 
      they'll usually keep their feelings in check rather than appearing to lose 
      self-control, even at the risk of seeming hard-nosed or cold. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In contrast, 
      people on the Feeling end of the scale are typically more comfortable 
      basing their actions on personal, emotional factors. When considering 
      their course, this type will consult their feelings first and will almost 
      always show concern for others. For the most part, these individuals are 
      sympathetic and sentimental. As a result, many times they can be swayed by 
      powerful desire or a touching appeal. Feeling people tend to be 
      softhearted when making decisions. They don't like to hurt anyone's 
      feelings. It's not that Feeling individuals necessarily have more or 
      deeper emotions than those on the Thinking end of the scale. They simply 
      let their feelings show more easily. This tendency makes them seem warmer 
      and friendlier, which in turn can give them an easier time getting along 
      with others. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The 
      Judgment/Perception (J-P) scale measures how people process information 
      and arrange their lives. Those who score high on Judgment tend to make up 
      their mind quickly and commit to schedules, while those scoring high on 
      Perception prefer to keep their options open and their timetables 
      flexible. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>People strong 
      in Judgment waste no time forming opinions or drawing conclusions. They 
      often report feeling a sense of urgency until a decision is made, and can 
      rest only after everything is settled. Closure and finality are important 
      to these individuals, as is orderly procedure. As a result, they can be 
      quick to make schedules, agendas, or timetables for themselves and others 
      to follow. People strong in Judgment will establish deadlines and take 
      them seriously, expecting others will do the same. They're usually 
      comfortable with routines and can be willing to do all sorts of 
      maintenance and cleaning up after a task, feeling that these are necessary 
      steps for a job's completion. For this type, neatness counts. They usually 
      feel unhappy or unsettled when their personal space is a mess. 
      Straightening things up is often near the top of their list. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>For their 
      part, people given to Perception keep their eyes open to what's around 
      them, gathering information and looking for opportunities and alternatives 
      that might be available. They usually feel no hurry to nail things down or 
      settle on a finished product. Instead, they tend to prefer exploring 
      possibilities. These individuals are often playful and spontaneous in 
      action. Schedules can make them feel hurried and over-controlled; they 
      tend to look upon deadlines as mere reminders to get on with the job. 
      Also, People high in Perception prefer their work to be enjoyable and 
      meaningful. If a task of routine maintenance or clean up falls to them, 
      they may balk at doing it, or may leave it to someone else. Easy-going, 
      even somewhat impulsive, these people are usually quite tolerant of mess. 
      Their personal spaces are often cluttered with an assortment of things 
      they've picked up, used, then dropped and forgotten about. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#003399 
      size=3>What is temperament? </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>There are two 
      sides to personality: One is temperament and the other is character. 
      Temperament is a set of inclinations we are born with, while character is 
      a set of habits we acquire as we grow and mature. Character is 
      disposition, developed over a lifetime; temperament is predisposition, 
      hardwired in from birth. Thus, those of the Artisan temperament are 
      predisposed to impulsive action, those of the Guardian temperament to 
      responsible service, those of the Idealist temperament to personal 
      development, and those of the Rational temperament to objective analysis. 
      Each type of person, unless blocked or deflected by an unfavorable 
      environment, will develop the habits of character appropriate to his or 
      her temperament. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Put another 
      way, our brain is a sort of computer that has temperament for its hardware 
      and character for its software. Our hardware is the physical base of our 
      personality, placing on each of us an unmistakable temperament signature, 
      some facets of which can be observed from a very early age. Our software 
      on the other hand, is made up of our individual experience and social 
      environment -- the forces around us that, with time and occasion, give 
      shape to our individual character. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Thus 
      temperament is the inborn form of human nature and character is the 
      emergent form that develops through the interaction of temperament and 
      environment. Personality, your unique personal style, is a combination of 
      the two. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In your 
      personal life, being knowledgeable about temperament can help you build 
      strong, lasting ties with others. This is true because it aids you in 
      anticipating your loved ones' needs and respecting their different ways of 
      dealing with life. When you are responsive to others, you will naturally 
      be looked upon as dependable, responsible, helpful, and empathetic. These
