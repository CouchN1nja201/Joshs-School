Project 1 Part A

BBOX71.EXE

1. Domain: x = all integers where 0 < x <=16
2. Range:  y = all integers where 1 <= y <=65535
3. One-to-one: Yes, no two values to x result in the same output.
4. y = 2^x - 1 where x is a real integer.

BBOX72.EXE

1. Domain: x = all integers where 0 < x < 100000
2. Range:  y = T or F.
3. One-to-one: No, x could be any number of values (1,2,3,etc) and y would still be T.
4. y is T ONLY when x is an integer that's a palindrome (read the same backwards and forwards... ie, 101, 202, 2002) and x is within the domain of question 1.

BBOX73.EXE

1. Domain: A <= x <= Z
2. Range: y = 44-49, 4A-4F. 50-59, 5A, 41-43
3. One-to-One: Yes, I can detemine the value of x by looking at the value of y.
4. Starting with x = a (y = 44), y increases by one integer value as you go through the letters of the alphabet, until y = 5A (x = W), then y = 41 (x = X) and continues through Z where it is one integer less than the beginning (y = 43).

BBOX74.EXE

1. Domain: all real numbers where 0 <= x <= 10.
2. Range: all real numbers where 0 <= y <= 1600.
3. One-to-one: Yes, no two values of x can be inputted for the same value of y, or vice-versa (the values are continuous).
4. y = (100 - x^2)*16

BBOX75.EXE

1. Domain: a <= x < =z OR any combination of lower case letters <= 6 characters.
2. Range: 0 <= y <= 6
3. Vowels = 0, Consonants = 1.  y = all the characters in the combination added together (ie. abcde = (a=0,b=1,c=1,d=1,e=0) = 0+1+1+1+0 = 3).
