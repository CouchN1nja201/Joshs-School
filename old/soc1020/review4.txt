Title:  A Persistent Problem: Gender Inequality in the Legal Profession
Author: Thomas Adcock. New York Law Journal
Main Ideas:  The law industry is dominated by men, and the question is when it will be gender equal.
Import facts to support main idea:  52% of graduates are women, but the gap widens as you get further into the career.  Also, there were 19 portains of people in the Great Hall in NYC, and only one was a female.  Her portrait was smaller than the rest of theirs.  They brought up the subject of re-entry, when a women is away on leave, then comes back... most firms will not want them if they do that, they want someone more steady.
How it supports:  The article supports its side very clearly.  It gives very specific information regarding where women are at, and shows how badly they are discriminated against.
Identify holes:  The article says nothing about why the gap broadens later in the career.  It could be for other reasons besides discrimination, such as the woman having children and not wishing to continue their careers, but rather be at-home moms.
What is a good counter-arguement:  Like the last one, perhaps the women don't want to get into the career later in life. It's been proven that women change jobs more than men (as the article makes clear) so it doesn't need to be said that they are necessarily discriminated against.
What point could be added:  Many women are in prestige positions in the law industry, which shows that it can be done.  Law is a very competitive business, and a women needs to make her way in just as the men do.
Examples of propaganda, bias, etc... :  They automatically assume that because there are less women in the industry, that they are biased against.
