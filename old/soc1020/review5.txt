Title: New 'young old' and a burden
Author:  William Saletan

Main Ideas:  Social security is getting rediculous.  People are living longer, and retiring earlier.  The next generation may have to put 1/3 to 1/5 of their paychecks JUST to support their parents.
Three important facts:  In 1945, for every person on Social Security, 42 workers were paying for them.  In 2002, only 3.3 were paying for each one.  By 2030, 2.2 workers.  Also, senior citizens with diabetes dropped from 26 percent to less than 20 percent.  Also, average life expectancy past 65 rose from 14 years to 16 years. This resulted in a new group called the "young old".
How it supports its side:  It gets to the punchline by getting in your face.  The fact that 2.2 workers will be paying for each Social Security beneficiary in 2030 is absurd.
Holes in Argument:  The trouble is, when are we going to get rid of Social Security?  The fact is that the younger generation pays for the older, that means that one generation will get completely 'screwed' (for lack of a better term).
Good counter-argument:  People kind of need a "reward" for their life.  Even though they may not have saved up as much as they could have throughout their life, people deserve some sort of an income just for merely living as long as they did.
What could be added:  They base Social Security completely on age.  They shouldn't do this... they should take other things into consideration, such as health at the current time.  Many people are completely healthy that are over the age of 65, and shouldn't be getting this type of Social Security benefits, as they don't need it... they just keep on cashing the check.
Examples of propaganda, bias, etc:  No observations of bias or propaganda could be found, as far as I could tell.  However, it did pointed toward the complete opposite of what the Bush administration has tried to do... as it bashes things like Medicare and the like.
