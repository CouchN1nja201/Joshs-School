Title and Author/Presenter of Article/Presentation: "U.K. gay teens suffer disadvantage"
Briefly State the Main Ideas of this Article/Presentation:  Many UK schools have laws against racial discrimination, but only about 6% have laws against homophobic bullying.
List Three Important Facts That the Author/Presenter Uses to Support the Main Idea:  1.  Students have been found to leave school early and not be coming back because of the abuse.  2.  Lesbian women are also having trouble finding work.  3.  6% of schools in England and Wales have policies protecting gay students from bullying.
Show How this Article/Presentation Supports it’s Side of the Issue:  It gives blatant evidence that gays are being discriminated against, and it is hurting the economy itself because these people aren't staying in school, and they won't be able to get as good as jobs.
Identify Holes in it’s Argument: The article doesn't give any proof on how many people are dropping out of school, it just gives the assumption that a lot are, which could be false.
What Is a Good Counter-argument to the Thesis of this Article/Presentation? Gay teens have their issues, just as many other people do.  Look at some of the nerds.  Most hardly have any friends, and they get teased all the time.  Everyone has their problems, and gays should deal with them like the rest of us do.
What Point Could Be Added to it’s Argument?  Although gay teens are made fun of, it is a fact of life.  Where the line would need to be drawn is if a gay were harmed or killed because of the fact they are gay (Like what happened in Wyoming... although there could have been other reasons in that case too).
List Any Examples of Propaganda, Bias, or Faulty Reasoning That You Found in this Article/Presentation:  It gives a lot of "facts" that aren't really fact-driven, ie no viable sources are given.
