Presentation Layer

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_layer

--Responds to service requests from the application layer, and requests things to the service layer.
--"This layer deals with issues like how strings are represented - whether they use the Visual Basic method ("13,thisisastring") or the C++ method ("thisisastring\0")."
--Encryption is typically done at this level.
--Represents structure, such as XML
-- You can't tell the different between the application and the presentation layers in many application and protocols (ftp and telnet.  Also, http can have both aspects).
--http/html, xml, client-server databases, print and file servers.
