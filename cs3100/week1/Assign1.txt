1. They are in fact computers, because they are essentially hardware and software.  Just because the software isn't very complex (it just moves bits around) doesn't mean that it's not software.  They already have an operating system, as previously stated as "software".
2.  A system or software interrupt will switch you from user mode to kernel mode.

1.1  
a.  1) Since the programs share memory, other users have access to another persons memory, and they can read all their data that's currently in memory.
    2)
b.  You can't, because since the system is shared by multiple users, there is always a chance that the two users information can collide (IE, one user MAY sometime have access to another users data).

1.10
An interrupt is used by the device controller to notify the CPU that data transfer is done.
An interrupt occurs asynchronously, where traps occur synchronously.  A trap can be intentionally created, in order to stop the program from processing.  A user can program a trap, an example would be Ctrl+C

1.11
a.  A user requests a data transfer, and the device drivers fill a buffer with the information it needs, then instructs the DMA to take over.
b.  An interrupt is generated telling it it's complete.
c.  It does, because a user program could be waiting for the data, i.e. if the program is reading a file, it needs to wait for the data in that file before it can process it.

1.15
The hardware compares EVERY address generated in user mode with memory already in there, so you can't access any memory to another users memory.  If it does try to access it, then it generates a trap.
